# Comparing-Algorithms
The goal is to compare the training and test errors of Linear Regression,Quadratic Regression,KNN, and Bayes Error using simulated data set.We compare the performance of these specific algorithms.

The outcome of this project is that Bayes Error tend to have lowest test error compared to the other algorithms, while Linear Regression has the highest test error on the unseen simulated data

The code can be found in the compare.r file
